<span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>One of the most important thing in Dream League Soccer, just like in any other football simulation game out there is to master the controls and be able to take a good pass, a good cross or a good shot.</b></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b><br /></b></span>
<span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>The control scheme in Dream League Soccer seems to be extremely difficult to master, with shooting and aiming requiring quite a bit of practice.</b></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b><br /></b></span>
<span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>Make sure that you get all that practice as soon as possible, by playing as many matches as you can and always trying to improve. Even if you have way better players, you will still get bad results if you canâ€™t shoot or pass the ball!</b></span><br />
