<span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>Try not to sell any of your players for a while – keep a large squad in order to be able to swap players that get tired, but at the same time sign better and better players for your team.</b></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b><br /></b></span>
<span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>It’s all about their ratings and not their name, so just look for high quality players that come as cheap as possible.</b></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b><br /></b></span>
<span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>I know you would love to have the big names out there in your squad, but having quality players is all that matters. So set the lowest prices first and see what you can find for that money, them move up if there’s nothing good. Only look at the player stats, and never at their name!</b></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b><br /></b></span>
<span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>I would suggest to start by signing a solid forward first, because you will need a lethal player in the final third, then depending on how your squad plays, sign another great forward or a great midfielder.</b></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b><br /></b></span>
<span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>Remember that faster players are better than slower ones, so always consider speed a must have attribute for all your players.</b></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b><br /></b></span>
<span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>Later on, when you have a decently sized squad, you can start selling your low quality players and get better ones instead. Rinse and repeat until you build that dream team you have always wanted.</b></span><br />
